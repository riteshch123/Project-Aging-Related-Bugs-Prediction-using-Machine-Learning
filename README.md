# Paper (with code): Aging Related-Bugs Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is used to predict Aging-Related Bugs in a Software System using Machine learning. The use case also demonstrate the Class imbalance Problem faced in a dataset, which has been tackled by the use of oversampling techniques. 

This project has been published at a Springer Conference. Link to the paper is attached herein for a greater understanding of the work.
