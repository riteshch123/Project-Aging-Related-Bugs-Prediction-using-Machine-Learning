# Paper (with code): Aging Related-Bugs Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to anticipate aging-related bugs in a software system. The use case also demonstrates how oversampling techniques were used to address the Class imbalance Problem that was present in a dataset.

A Springer Conference has published this project. For a better understanding of the study, please refer to the attached link to the paper.
